# twiliotextingproject

The Twilio REST API allows you to query metadata about your account, phone numbers, calls, text messages, and recordings. You can also do some fancy things like initiate outbound calls and send text messages.

pip install twilio(to start)
create your free account in twilio
then go to https://www.twilio.com/console/ to get information such as ACCOUNT SID,AUTH TOKEN
also to send messages you must first verify that number from your twilio account
more information is given in comments in code

thank you
